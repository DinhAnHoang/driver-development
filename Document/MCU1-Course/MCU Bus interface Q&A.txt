MCU Bus interface:
Reference: S23F407

1. System bus is not conected to Flash memory, is it that true?
-> True, Flash memory only connected to I-Code (instruction code) and D-Code (Data code).

2. Processor can fetch instruction from SRAM over I-code bus T/F?
-> False

3. System bus can operate at speed upto 180mHz?
-> True

4. SRAM are conected to system bus?
-> true, over bus matrix.

5. APB1 bus can operate with speed upto 180mHz?
->False. only 45mHz

7. Processor can fetch instruction as well as data simultaneously from SRAM T/F?
->  False. Only 1 bus connected to SRAM

8. Processor can fetch instruction as well as data simultaneously from FLASH T/F?
->  True. Because have 2 bus are Icode and Dcode
