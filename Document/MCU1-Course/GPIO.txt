Reference : STM32F407 discovery board

1. GPIO REGISTER
 Port Direction (mode) register
 Port Speed Register 
 Port Output type Register
 Some other Configuration Register 
 Port Output Data Register
 Port Input Data Register
2. GPIO Port on STM32 Discovery board:
 9 port: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I
--> but on board are only 5 port (A,B,C,D,E) and 80 pin are connect to header board.
3. GPIO Register explain:
  3.1 GIIO port mode register (GPIOx_MODER) (Section 8.4.1)
    To config for each pin with mode:
    00: Input
    01: General purpose output mode
    10: alternate fuction mode
    11: Analog mode
  3.2: Input mode:
    - GPIO pin had support register pull-up (40M ohm) and pull down (40M ohm)
    - The pull-up and pull down depend on the value in the GPIOx_PUPDR register
    - The data present on the I/O pin are sampled into the input data register every AHB1 clock cycle
    - A read access to the input data register provides the I/O state -> that mean when we using feature ADC or DAC thourgh out pin GPIO need to set mode input. 
  3.3: output configuration:
    - Have 2 mode:
       + Push - Pull mode
       + Open drain mode
